            <p>Sauvage is an act of creation inspired by wide-open spaces. An ozone blue sky that dominates a white-hot rocky landscape.

                The strong gust of citrus in Sauvage Eau de Toilette is powerfully anchored by the ambery nobleness of ambroxan, resinous elemi and woods.

                    <p>Dior Homme Eau de Toilette is intriguingly powerful and appealingly fresh.

                        Dior Homme redefines a new, masculine sensuality with its composition of smooth and raw wood.
                        In the heart notes of tender wood lies the virility of Atlas Cedar embracing the enveloping warmth of Haitian Vetiver tinged with spices.
                         The wood is chiseled in-house at Dior.
