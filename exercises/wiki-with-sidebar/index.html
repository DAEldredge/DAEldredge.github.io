                    Nomadic hunters are estimated to have arrived in Virginia around 17,000 years ago. 
                    Evidence from Daugherty's Cave in Russell County shows it was regularly used as a rock shelter by 9,800 years ago.
                    [5] During the late Woodland period (500â€“1000 CE), tribes coalesced, and farming, first of corn and squash, began, with beans and tobacco arriving from the southwest and Mexico by the end of the period. 
                    Palisaded towns began to be built around 1200, and the native population in the current boundaries of Virginia reached around 50,000 in the 1500s.[6] Large groups in the area at that time included the 
                    Algonquian in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as Tsenacommacah, the Iroquoian-speaking Nottoway and Meherrin to the north and south, and the Tutelo, who spoke Siouan, to the west.[7]

                    In response to threats from these other groups to their trade network, thirty or so Virginia Algonquian-speaking tribes consolidated during the 1570s under Wahunsenacawh, known in English as Chief Powhatan.
                    [7] Powhatan controlled more than 150 settlements that had total population of around 15,000 in 1607.[8] Three-fourths of the native population in Virginia, however, died from smallpox and other Old World diseases
                     during that century,[9] disrupting their oral traditions and complicating research into earlier periods.[10] Additionally, many primary sources, including those that mention Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, were created 
                     by Europeans, who may have held biases or misunderstood native social structures and customs.[4][11]

                    Several European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits, explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century.[12] To help counter Spain's colonies in the Caribbean, Queen Elizabeth I of England supported Walter Raleigh's
                     April 1584 expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America.[13][14] The name "Virginia" was used by Captain Arthur Barlowe in the expedition's report, and may have been suggested that year by Raleigh or Elizabeth, perhaps noting 
                     her status as the "Virgin Queen" or that they viewed the land as being untouched, and may also be related to an Algonquin phrase, Wingandacoa or Windgancon, or leader's name, Wingina, as heard by the expedition.[15][16] The name initially 
                     applied to the entire coastal region from South Carolina in the south to Maine in the north, along with the island of Bermuda.[17] Raleigh's colony failed disastrously, but his ideas persisted, and in 1606, King James I issued a charter for a new colony to the London Company. 
                     They financed an expedition under Christopher Newport that crossed the Atlantic and established a settlement named Jamestown in May 1607.[18]

                    The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bay was formed from the drowned river valley of the ancient Susquehanna River.
                    [96] Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay, traditionally referred to as "necks" named Northern Neck, 
                    Middle Peninsula, and the Virginia Peninsula from north to south.[97] Sea level rise has eroded the land on Virginia's islands, which include Tangier Island in the bay and Chincoteague, one of 23 barrier islands on the Atlantic coast.[98][99]

                    The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills
                     east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic era.[100] The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains around Charlottesville.[101] The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province 
                     of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the Commonwealth, the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet (1,746 m).[2] The Ridge-and-Valley region is west of the mountains, carbonate rock based, and includes the 
                     Massanutten Mountain ridge and the Great Appalachian Valley, which is called the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, named after the river of the same name that flows through it.[102] The Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains 
                     are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the Allegheny Plateau. In this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the Ohio River basin.[103]
