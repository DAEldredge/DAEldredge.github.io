        <h2>Student Journey at F.I.R.S.T</h2>
            <p>
              During my time at F.I.R.S.T, I embarked on an incredible journey in the world of design. I honed my skills, learned various design principles, and gained practical experience that has shaped my career as a Graphic Designer.
              <br>
              F.I.R.S.T provided me with a solid foundation and a platform to explore my creative potential, allowing me to grow both personally and professionally in the field of graphic design.
